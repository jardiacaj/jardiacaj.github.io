This blog has no functionality for adding comments, or liking, or anything similar. Welcome back to Web 1.0, or as it was called then, the Internet.

Why? Unfortunately most comment sections online have become hopeless cesspools.

I also want to keep this site simple. (I'm happy it doesn't need cookies. There's no tracking.)

But you want to comment, give feedback, connect, or are really motivated to scam me? I am truly glad you are ðŸ¥°

### Option 1: email

Send me an email at [qcadzkaty@mozmail.com](mailto:qcadzkaty@mozmail.com). Please understand if I need some time to get back to you.

If you are commenting on a post, let me know if you want me to add it to the site and I'll gladly do. Let me know if you want me to share your name or contact data (e.g. a link to your site or profile).

### Option 2: GitHub

We can chat in the repo's [GH discussions](https://github.com/jardiacaj/jardiacaj.github.io/discussions). (Which requires a GitHub account)
