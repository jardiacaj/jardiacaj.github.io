This blog has no functionality for adding comments, or liking, or anything similar.

Why? Unfortunately most comment sections online have become hopeless cesspools of toxicity, proud ignorance and scams. I also want to keep this site simple. (25KB of static assets are still more I had hoped and I'm happy it doesn't need cookies. There's no tracking.)

But you want to comment, give feedback, connect, or are really motivated to scam me? I am truly glad you are ðŸ¥°

### Option 1: contact me via email

Send me an email at [qcadzkaty@mozmail.com](mailto:qcadzkaty@mozmail.com). Don't expect an immediate reply.

If you want to comment on a post, let me know if you want me to add it to the site and I'll gladly do. Let me know if you want me to share your name or contact data (e.g. a link to your site or profile).

### Option 2: GitHub

Feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/jardiacaj/jardiacaj.github.io/compare) or [file an issue](https://github.com/jardiacaj/jardiacaj.github.io/issues/new) in GitHub.
