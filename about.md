I'm Joan Ardiaca Jové. This is my blog. I'm glad you're here.

The [inaugural post]({% post_url 2025-05-31-first-step %}) will tell you why this blog exists.

You can find me in [Github](https://github.com/jardiacaj) (although it's mostly old stuff there), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-ardiaca-jov%C3%A9-2365571b6/) and somewhere in real life.
